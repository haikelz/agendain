## Getting Started

- Clone this repo
- Go to the project folder, and install all dependencies using your favorite package manager. I'm using pnpm, so i can type `pnpm install`. Btw if you use other package manager, don't forget to delete `pnpm-lock.yaml` file.
- After all dependecies installed, type `pnpm run dev` and see the result in `http://localhost:3000`
